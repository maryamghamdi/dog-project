# Installation:
Python version 3
- Libraries:
  - sklearn.
  - keras.
  - glob.
  - random.
  - cv2.
  - tqdm.
  - PIL.
  - numpy.
  - matplotlib.

# Project Overview:
In this project, we build a pipeline that can be used within a web or mobile app to process real-world, user-supplied images.  Given an image of a dog, your algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed.  If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.  


# File Descriptions:
 1. dog_app.html: 
     - HTML file that contains all the code.
 2. dog_app.ipynb: 
     - Jupyter file that contains all the code.
 3. extract_bottleneck_features.py: 
     - This file contains all the functions needed to extract the bottleneck features.
 4. haarcascades: 
    - This folder contains one XML file which is a pre-trained face detectors from openCV.
 5. images:
    - This folder contains images showed in the Jupyter file.
 6. test_images:
    - This folder contains images used to test our algorithm.
 7. LICENSE.txt: 
    - This file for licensing.
